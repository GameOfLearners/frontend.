# Game of Learners Season 1: Mizizi Project 
Mizizi is a Swahili name that means "Roots". We decided to use this name because this application provides a platform that analyzes a user's sysmptoms and prescribes locally available remedies and medications first, before recommending the user to a medical professional. 

Medical care is an essential service in all parts of the world. In Kenya accessibility to health care is hampered by various problems. 
Mizizi is a platform that provides users with up to date and accurate information on their healthcare needs. 
Features inlcude:

*First Aid Section for providing visual guides, for the illiterate users, and textual guides on performing different first aid procedures in case of minor accidents.
*Finding chemists close to a user's location
*Storing a user's medical records and providing a medical report that can be shared to medical officers during treatment procedures
